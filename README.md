If you are worried about authorities or the company you work for reading your messages, you should take precautions. Technology solutions are imperfect, but here are a few tactics for making contact:

<b>CHAT MESSENGERS</b>

Signal is the gold-standard for encrypted messaging and phone calls. You can download it here: https://whispersystems.org/

You can add my mobile phone number to your contacts and I'll pop up as available. If you don't want to save my number, you can also send message through the system by typing my number into the search box and it will give you the option to click "New conversation with +447746516719."

Signal will keep a record of when you set up an account and what phone number you've used, which can be sensitive information.

WhatsApp is ok for most things, but it has weaknesses. I don't recommend Telegram, Threema or text messages.
